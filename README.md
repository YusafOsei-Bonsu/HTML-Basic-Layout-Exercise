# Task 1: Setting up the Basic Layout of the Homepage

You have already set up an HTML5 web page for your News home page. You want to set up the basic layout of the page by defining different parts using non-semantic elements such as `<div>`, `<span>`, `<ul>`, and `<table>` and a few semantic elements such as `<header>` and `<nav>` elements. You need to add code so that your page structure reflects these elements.

Complete the exercise in the following steps:

1. Create a header for the name of your site which is "Independent News". &#9745;
2. Create DIV containers for the header and give it a background color of orange. &#9745;
3. Create a nested DIV container within the "Independent News" DIV container that contains the words "Homepage" and give it a background color of another shade of orange. &#9745;
4. Set up another div container to hold a navigation menu. &#9745;
5. Add the navigation system to the DIV by using an unordered list that has "News", "Sports", "Weather", and "Entertainment" as navigation links. &#9745;
6. Create a table with headers and three rows to display Weather information. Use the following information: 
     - Monday – 30 – mostly cloudy &#9745;
     - Tuesday – 29 – clear &#9745;
     - Wednesday – 27 – cloudy with showers &#9745;
7. Specify dimensions to the three divs you created using the values of your choosing, which contribute to an intuitive layout.
